The second program is Boggle.

Boggle is a word game designed by Bill Cooke and invented by Allan Turoff and originally distributed by Parker Brothers.The game is played using a plastic grid of lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters.

It has a bug - it counts duplicated words - because 5 words could be found using different paths.
